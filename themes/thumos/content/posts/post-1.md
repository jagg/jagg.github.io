List comprehensions are one of Python's most elegant features, but there's more to them than the basic syntax most developers know.

## Conditional Logic in Comprehensions

You can add filtering and conditional expressions to create powerful one-liners:

```python
# Filter with condition
evens = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
# [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

# Conditional expression with very long line to demonstrate horizontal scrolling
signs = ['positive' if x > 0 else 'negative' if x < 0 else 'zero' for x in [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]
# ['negative', 'zero', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive']

# Another long line example
processed_data = [transform_complex_function(item) for item in large_dataset if validate_item(item) and item.status == 'active' and item.priority > 5]
```

## Nested Comprehensions

For processing nested structures, you can chain comprehensions:

```python
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
flattened = [item for row in matrix for item in row]
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# With filtering - this line is intentionally long to show horizontal scrolling behavior
odds_only = [transform_and_validate_item(item, additional_param=True, config={'mode': 'strict', 'validation': True}) for row in matrix for item in row if item % 2 == 1 and item > minimum_threshold]
# [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

# Complex nested comprehension with long variable names
result = [{'processed_value': calculate_complex_metric(value), 'metadata': generate_metadata_dict(value)} for sublist in nested_data_structure for value in sublist if meets_complex_criteria(value)]
```

## Performance Considerations

List comprehensions are generally faster than equivalent for loops, but they're not always the best choice:

- Use generators for large datasets to save memory
- Consider `map()` and `filter()` for simple transformations
- Profile your code when performance matters

The key is readability - if your comprehension becomes too complex, a regular loop might be clearer.
